      <div class="content">
        <p>In early August 2024, after successfully completing my exam as an IT Systems Management Specialist, I decided to undertake a six-week internship in Crete. I came across MD Hellas, a company that operates both as an internship placement and travel agency. They offered me the chance to work in Front-End Web Development, despite my limited prior knowledge in this area. During my internship, I gained extensive insights and learned a lot, including programming this website.</p>
        
        <p>In my free time, I fully enjoyed the beauty and diversity of Crete. My apartment was located in Amoudara, a district of Heraklion, right by the beach – a setting that provided me with stunning sea views and a relaxing atmosphere. I also met many other Germans who were doing internships, so I always had company for various activities.</p>
        
        <p>Highlights of my stay included visiting the Heraklion Archaeological Museum, exploring the historic city walls, and admiring the picturesque harbor of Heraklion. With a few friends, I rented a car to explore cities like Rethymnon, Chania, and Malia. Particularly impressive was Lake Kournas, the only natural freshwater lake on Crete. The crystal-clear water and the opportunity to rent pedal boats and observe the turtles living in the lake made this excursion an unforgettable experience.</p>

        <p>On my last weekend, I joined some people I had met during my stay for an unforgettable sailing trip to the island of Dia. We were on a small sailboat, and despite the rough seas, it was an incredible feeling to ride the waves. Upon arriving at Dia Island, we dropped anchor and had the chance to snorkel in the clear waters, which was also a delightful experience. Afterward, we enjoyed a meal on board and sailed back to Crete during the sunset – truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>
